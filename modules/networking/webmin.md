Webmin is a web-based system administration tool for Unix-like servers, and services with over *1,000,000* installations worldwide. Using it, it is possible to configure operating system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services or configuration files, as well as modify, and control open-source apps, such as BIND DNS Server, Apache HTTP Server, PHP, MySQL, and many more.

Usability can be expanded by installing modules, which can be custom made. Aside from this, there are two other major projects that extend its functionality:

-   Virtualmin is a powerful, flexible, most popular, and most comprehensive web-hosting control panel for Linux, and BSD systems, with over *150,000* installations worldwide. It is available in an open-source community-supported version, and a more feature-filled version with premium support;

-   Usermin presents and controls a subset of user-centred features, rather than administrator-level tasks.

Webmin includes *116* standard modules, and there are at least as many third-party modules.

### Requirements

Perl 5.10 or higher.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Webmin can be installed in two different ways:

1.  By downloading a pre-built package, available for different distributions (CentOS, Fedora, SuSE, Mandriva, Debian, Ubuntu, Solaris and other under latest release assets.

2.  By downloading, extracting source file script, with no arguments, which will setup to run it directly from this directory, or with a command-line argument, such as targeted directory. `Note: If you are installing Webmin on Windows system, you must run the command `perl setup.pl` instead. The Windows version depends on several programs, and modules that may not be part of the standard distribution. You will need *process.exe* command, *sc.exe* command, and *Win32::Daemon* Perl module.`
