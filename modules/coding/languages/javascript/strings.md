# Javascript Strings

The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.

As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.

Syntax
Use the following syntax to create a String object âˆ’

var val = new String(string);
The String parameter is a series of characters that has been properly encoded.

String Properties

Sr.No.	Property & Description
1	constructor
Returns a reference to the String function that created the object.

2	length
