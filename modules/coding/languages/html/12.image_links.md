# HTML Image Links

We have seen how to create hypertext link using text and we also learnt how to use images in our webpages. Now, we will learn how to use images to create hyperlinks.

**Example**

It's simple to use an image as hyperlink. We just need to use an image inside hyperlink at the place of text as shown below âˆ’

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>Image Hyperlink Example</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      <p>Click following link</p>
      <a href = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com" target = "_self">
         <img src = "/images/logo.png" alt = "Tutorials Point" border = "0"/>
      </a>
   </body>

</html>
```
This will produce a page where you can click on the images to reach to the home page of Tutorials Point.
