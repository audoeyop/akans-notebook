# C# Introduction

C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).

C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.

C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.

The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language -

-   It is a modern, general-purpose programming language
-   It is object oriented.
-   It is component oriented.
-   It is easy to learn.
-   It is a structured language.
-   It produces efficient programs.
-   It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
-   It is a part of .Net Framework.

Strong Programming Features of C#
---------------------------------

Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming language. It has strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.

Following is the list of few important features of C# -

-   Boolean Conditions
-   Automatic Garbage Collection
-   Standard Library
-   Assembly Versioning
-   Properties and Events
-   Delegates and Events Management
-   Easy-to-use Generics
-   Indexers
-   Conditional Compilation
-   Simple Multithreading
-   LINQ and Lambda Expressions
-   Integration with Windows

The .Net Framework
------------------

The .Net framework is a revolutionary platform that helps you to write the following types of applications -

-   Windows applications
-   Web applications
-   Web services

The .Net framework applications are multi-platform applications. The framework has been designed in such a way that it can be used from any of the following languages: C#, C++, Visual Basic, Jscript, COBOL, etc. All these languages can access the framework as well as communicate with each other.

The .Net framework consists of an enormous library of codes used by the client languages such as C#. Following are some of the components of the .Net framework -

-   Common Language Runtime (CLR)
-   The .Net Framework Class Library
-   Common Language Specification
-   Common Type System
-   Metadata and Assemblies
-   Windows Forms
-   ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX
-   ADO.Net
-   Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)
-   Windows Presentation Foundation
-   Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
-   LINQ

For the jobs each of these components perform, please seeÂ [ASP.Net - Introduction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/asp.net/asp.net_introduction.htm), and for details of each component, please consult Microsoft's documentation.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C#
-----------------------------------------------

Microsoft provides the following development tools for C# programming -

-   Visual Studio 2010 (VS)
-   Visual C# 2010 Express (VCE)
-   Visual Web Developer

The last two are freely available from Microsoft official website. Using these tools, you can write all kinds of C# programs from simple command-line applications to more complex applications. You can also write C# source code files using a basic text editor, like Notepad, and compile the code into assemblies using the command-line compiler, which is again a part of the .NET Framework.

Visual C# Express and Visual Web Developer Express edition are trimmed down versions of Visual Studio and has the same appearance. They retain most features of Visual Studio. In this tutorial, we have used Visual C# 2010 Express.
